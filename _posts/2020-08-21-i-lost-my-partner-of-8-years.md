What happens now? How does one carry on? They all tell you to prepare for this moment, and logistically you do all you can, but is it worth carrying on? They tell you to think of the happy times, the good times but it doesn't fix anything. The void is not satisfied, and will never be. The void will never go away, no matter how much you try to escape it and cover it up. It lurks in the corner, sapping away passively. 

The emptiness is more painful than the void can be ever hope to be. Filling the emptiness is a futile taks, as it rejects everything you put into it. It's like a puzzle piece which will forever be incompatible with any other piece. The only piece that would fit, is now forever gone. The emptiness, unlike the void cannot be hidden. It exists at the very core. But acceptance of the emptiness feels like the first step in comprehending the shock.

It was a long time coming.
